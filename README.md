## Description
Word Puzzle takes input from the keyboard and checks the words in the letters. It is recommended to put the input information in a separate file. There are several test files in the `io` folder.

The input files are formatted as follows:
```
WAQHGTTWEECBMIVQQELSAZXWKWIIILLDWLFXPIPVPONDTMVAMNOEDSOYQGOBLGQCKGMMCTYCSLOACUZMXVDMGSXCYZUUIUNIXFNU
UNIX CALPOLY GCC SLO COMPILE VIM TEST
```
The first line has the input letters and the second line has the words, space delimitated.

Alternatively, you can type the input. It requests input (first the letters and second the words.)

To run, this program, type
```sh
user:~ $ python wordFinder.py < inputFile
```
